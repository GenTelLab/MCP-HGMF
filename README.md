## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.10.x
- **Conda**: For virtual environment management
- **Hardware**: Compatible with standard GPU setups

### Environment Setup

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n hgmf_env python=3.10 -y
   conda activate hgmf_env
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Model Download

1. Download the required Large Language Model (LLM) via **Ollama**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull <llm-name>
   ```

2. Launch the model server:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```

### Dataset
Dataset Resource ：This dataset is derived from the official MCP repository, containing all filtered tools from the repo: it includes 308 servers and a total of 2,797 tools. For subsequent task adaptation , I have converted the tool data in this dataset into  embeddings .
The following datasets are included in the repository:
- `data_embeddings.json`: 🗄️ Origin Embeddings for tools and servers.
- `professional_embedding.json`: 📋 Professional description embeddings.

## 🧪 Running Experiments

1. **Execute the Main Program**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Results**:
   Experiment outputs will be saved in the `grid_search_results/` directory for easy access and analysis.

## ⚙️ Configuration

- Modify experiment parameters in `config.py` to customize your setup.
- Adjust the sample size for experiments in `utils.py` to fine-tune performance.
- sampler.py ：Tweak parameters for hierarchical Gaussian mixture sampling and clustering logic:
<sample_threshold> ：Threshold for triggering clustering during sampling .
<n_clusters>  ：Number of clusters for sampling. If set to None, the value is automatically calculated as the square root of the total sample count (sqrt(N)).
<sample_num> ：Maximum number of samples selected per cluster .
<topk_cluster> ：Top-k high-priority clusters selected for sampling .
<lambda_inter> ：Mean regularization weight for inter-cluster constraints .
<beta_intra> ：Penalty weight for the trace of intra-cluster covariance .
<w_balance> ：Directional penalty weight for intra-cluster covariance .
<max_iter> ：Maximum number of iterations for the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm .
<tol> ：Convergence tolerance based on log-likelihood .
<reg_covar> ：Base regularization term for covariance matrices .
